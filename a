When in the chronicle of wasted time
I see descriptions of the fairest wights
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
In praise of ladies dead, and lovely knights
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow
I see their antique pen would have express'd
Even such a beauty as you master now
So all their praises are but prophecies
Of this our time, all you prefiguring
And, for they look'd but with divining eyes
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
For we, which now behold these present days
Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise
When my love swears that she is made of truth
I do believe her, though I know she lies
That she might think me some untutor'd youth
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young
Although she knows my days are past the best
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
And wherefore say not I that I am old?
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust
And age in love loves not to have years told:
Therefore I lie with her and she with me
And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.
